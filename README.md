# Project Prompt
## Assignment Base Prompt:
The course project offers a valuable opportunity to apply your data mining and data science skills
to a significant and relevant real-world problem. You will work with a team, choosing a project
topic after discussing it with the instructor. This project allows for great flexibility in terms of topic
selection, so take advantage of this opportunity to make a significant impact! \
### Project requirements:
- Your project must use non-trivial data. Possible datasets:
- Previous projects and datasets
- https://www.dropbox.com/s/54b9zkveoz365zb/Project.docx?dl=0
- https://paperswithcode.com/datasets
- Altmetrics – https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zcloke9egpomdza/AAD0IOQrtcw-yUZMVK56R8-za?dl=0
- More Datasets - publications, patents, grants, clinical trials,

- Your project must apply a data science or analytics algorithm.
- Your project must use the “data science loop”, ultimately leading to a data product or data visualization that will support or guide decision-making.

### Grading
- 10%: Project Proposal
- 10%: Checkpoint
- 80%: Project Presentation and Deliverables \
Recall that your late days are applicable to homework assignments only. All project milestones
are due on their respective due date. No late project milestones will be accepted. We will have an
in-class feedback component associated with the proposal and the checkpoint

### Project Proposal
Each group should post a 2-4 page (1000-2000 words) project proposal to Blackboard. You should
include:
- Team Information: The name of your team and the team members
- Problem significance: Clearly state why the problem is important. Who will benefit from solving this problem?
- Research Hypothesis: What are the key questions your project aims to answer.
- Related work: Summarize the existing work in this area. Include at least 20 citations to provide context and support for your project
- Data sources: Describe the datasets you will use and why they are apppropriate for your project.
- Methods: Outline the techniques and tools you plan to use. Include specific data science libraries or software packages.
- Innovation: Highlight what makes your project novel. How does it differ from previous work?
- Evaluation: How will you measure the success of your project? Define the metrics you will use to validate your results.
- Timeline: Provide a detailed schedule with milestones, including who will be responsible for each task
- Expected Results: Include a preliminary sketch or hypothesis of what you aim to achieve.

### Checkpoint: Exploratory Data Analysis and Prototype (2-4 pages PDF)
- Data Summary: Present descriptive statistics and initial insights from your dataset
- Data cleaning: Docment any data preprocessing or cleaning steps taken
- Insights: Outline any key findings and planned next steps
- Feature engineering: Discuss any features or topics you have identified
- Accuracy Improvements: Suggest methods to enhance the accuracy of your model or analysis
- Prototype: Provide a draft or prototype of your data product or visualization

### Project Deliverables
The final milestone includes the submission of a report (6000-8000 words) along with your code,
data, presentation slides, and any additional resources used. Your report should be written in
a format similar to a conference paper, addressing all the key questions from your proposal in
greater detail. Discuss challenges faced, experimental results, and potential future extensions of
your work.
